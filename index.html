            <p>You have already seen code for using list functions in Chapter 13. This example 
                uses those functions to perform practical work. The append() function adds a 
                new record to NewData. However, notice that the data is added as a string, not 
                as a FormatData object. The data is stored as strings on disk, so that’s what 
                you get when the data is read back in. You can either add the new data as a 
                string or create a FormatData object and then use the __str__() method to 
                output the data as a string.
